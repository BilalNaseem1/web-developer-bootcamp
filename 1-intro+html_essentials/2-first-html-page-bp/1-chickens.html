        <b>Chicken</b>
    </h1>
    <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl
        of
        Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept
        as
        pets or for cockfighting.

        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual
        production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are
        numerous
        cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and
        the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them
        to
        fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both
        sexes
        have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under
        their
        beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes
        extra
        feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]
